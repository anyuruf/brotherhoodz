            The Blood metrix!!!

                Considering the people you know in our clan, will discover that if you moved like
                three to four generations back, that y'all come from the same grandfather.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, if all these clan members have children with people from say three hundred other clans, this 
                would make your grandfather a bloodbrother to all these clans and the clans they 
                are bloodbrothers with.
            </p>
            <p>
                That is why in our culture we greet everyone we meet and tribes have kings and clans. Jesus comes
                from David's clans hence our bloodbrother.
